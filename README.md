# Array.With.Exercise-6-Java
Understanding the coding technique of Arrays & implementing bank system  - Refresh! 🌿

I took my past university minor assignment & mini project on brushing up memory skills of Java and understanding the concept once more. 💫

In this repo, I have learnt to code the following: 👩‍🎓💻

1. Write a full Java program that generate **an array with 10 integer elements.**
   • Implement the concept of repetition statement to do this.
   • In addition, catch the ArrrayIndexOutOfBoundsException by displaying to the user "Invalid index entered". 
Next, find the largest number from the array.

2.  **Mini Project:** Write a class called BankAccount with following requirements:
• Variables: accountNumber and balance
• Functions: deposit() and withdraw()
Create an BankAccount object with an **account number of 1234** and a **balance of
$1000**. Use the withdraw method to **withdraw $500**, use the deposit method to **deposit
$1500**, and print the balance. The **default value** for the account number and balance
are **0**.


## GitHub Lesson Learnt 🔍📝 ## 
None for now! :)

## Extras 💡 ##
- Create 2 different windows (code panels) for BankAccount to view code easily amongst the two working with each other.
- Implemented **Encapsulation** method (Getters & Setters method)


  ## End of Lesson - Thank You! ##
